# Advanced Lane Detection

[![Udacity - Self-Driving Car NanoDegree](https://s3.amazonaws.com/udacity-sdc/github/shield-carnd.svg)](http://www.udacity.com/drive)

A repository for the advanced lane detection exercises and project from Udacity's Self-Driving Car Engineer nanodegree. (Project #2)

Like the first project, the goal of this project is to take an image of the road and build a pipeline to detect the lanes in it. This project will be more difficult, however: the lanes will be curving and there will be shadows on the road. This will require more complicated solutions than the ones implemented previously.

Some basic scripts from the lessons and exercises are located in [`scripts/`](./scripts). The images used for those scripts are found in [`images/`](./images). The project, started from the project Udacity repository [here](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-Advanced-Lane-Lines), is found in [`project/`](./project).

## The Project

There is no Jupyter Notebook for this project. You will find everything you need on the project in the `project/` directory.

- The main Python script can be found at [`project/advanced_lane_finding.py`](./project/advanced_lane_finding.py)
- The library of supporting functions can be found at [`project/p2_functions.py`](./project/p2_functions.py)
- The images output by the pipeline are in [`project/output_images/`](./project/output_images/)
- The output video is at [`project/output_video.mp4`](./project/output_video.mp4)
- The writeup for the project is at [`project/writeup.md`](./project/writeup.md).
