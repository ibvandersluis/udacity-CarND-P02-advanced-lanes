# Lane Detection

[![Udacity - Self-Driving Car NanoDegree](https://s3.amazonaws.com/udacity-sdc/github/shield-carnd.svg)](http://www.udacity.com/drive)

A repository for the advanced lane detection exercises and project from Udacity's Self-Driving Car Engineer nanodegree. (Project #2)

Like the first project, the goal of this project is to take an image of the road and build a pipeline to detect the lanes in it. This project will be more difficult, however: the lanes will be curving and there will be shadows on the road. This will require more complicated solutions than the ones implemented previously.

Some basic scripts from the lessons and exercises are located in [`scripts/`](./scripts). The images used for those scripts are found in [`images/`](./images). The project, started from the project Udacity repository [here](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-Advanced-Lane-Lines), is found in [`project/`](./project).

## Launching the Project

Navigate to the `project/` directory and run

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

Then open P1.ipynb.

Find the writeup for the project [here](./project/writeup.md).
